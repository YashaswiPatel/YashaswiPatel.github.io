<h1>Problem</h1>
<pre>
<h4>Gradually over time, we have had technological innovations in every field, including the field of medicine.
But, sadly for a country like ours where we find huge disparities in the standard of life, a similar situation is
apparent here as well. These include not just the healthcare facilities available to the different areas but
also the awareness among different people. And the worst part, the most neglected section are women.
A recent study conducted by AIIMS, Delhi pointed out that ‘Women in India are not only treated unfairly
when they need consultation of specialist doctors but also when they need hospitalisation’.</h4>

<h4>The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in India stands at 113 in 2016-18. It is defined as the number of
maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births, and the targeted number as per the Sustained Development
Goals of the United Nations is below 70.
We realise that there needs to be a huge initiative taken by not only the government, but also each and
every individual so as to be able to reach this goal.
So, the objective of my project is to collect data from the remote areas where proper healthcare facilities
are unavailable, and then use this data in a number of ways so as to be able to help these people in
lowering the risk of Maternal Deaths.

<h2>Methodology and Applications</h2>
<pre><h4>
The primary task is Data collection with the help of a form that includes simple details like menstrual
problems, blood pressure, and BMI among others.
This task can be carried out through a number of ways, with the most simple and effective being a
collaboration with the different NGOs who actively work for the people in these remote areas.
The next step is the comparison of an individual's data with a standard that marks the normal level, like
18 to 23 is the normal BMI for a pregnant lady. In case of abnormal numbers, a warning is displayed
containing the necessary dietary recommendations and also the nearest hospital with a list of specialised
doctors. This helps the female know about the deficiency she might be unaware of.</h4>

<h4>The final step is a graph of the cumulative data which represents the various reasons which are a cause
for maternal deaths in a specified area, like the average value of iron/carbon in the blood samples of
women in villages near the industrial area will be higher than normal and therefore requires a specialised
treatment.This graph could vary for different age groups, for different areas, for different classes of
women and this opens up a variety of ways to rectify the fault we’ve been making all along.
This could be through medical workshops by the above agents we collaborated with so as to make the
whole community aware of the issue. Another option could be a supplementation drive if there is a lack of
dietary components that could be carried on by the government agencies.</h4>

<h2>Future Ideas</h2>

● For the demonstration part we have assumed that the data is from a single location and
recommended the hospital accordingly. But in future we can expand this idea by taking the
location of the village and recommending the nearest list of hospitals and the specialised doctors
that need to be consulted.

● Personal report for each patient can be generated after submission is done.The report will include
all aspects like the menstrual cycle, occupation, medical history, age and help in knowing
deficiencies and problems. Medicines and supplements can be recommended accordingly.
● We can also use different Machine learning algorithms to analyse the data and give more
specialised feedback.
● Another interesting component which we could make use of, is the role of Data Analysts who can
analyse the vast amount of data available with us and work upon the various areas that could be
of interest.
